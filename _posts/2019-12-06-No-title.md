### What had you done yesterday?

* Finished the Menu system. Tested the input mode to build the keyboard and gamepad input, the result is I have to code Playercontroller and InputMode so that I can realize my idea effect.
* Updated local home page, learnt the anime.js -- a powerful web anime javerscript framework. And pug(gulp)/liquid(jekyll) for html, scss/less for css and ejs/coffescript for javascript are the useful tools for web development.

### What will you do today?

- Start the Multiplayer Online programing.
- Finish the binary tree.
