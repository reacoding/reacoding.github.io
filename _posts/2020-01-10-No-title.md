### What had you done yesterday?

* The process of calculating data and ploting for all stocks in post ten year, has beend done. It took around 1 day and two hours.
* Finished the initial algorithm about special up data analysis code. But still need to do more detailed analysis.

### What will you do today?

- Analyse the sample data and think to deploy for all stock data.
- Finish the python DSA note work, (delay so long time).

PS:  Focused on the python too deeply, so that didn't do well at EF group lesson, it's not a good habit. Be careful, don't forget notice something you need to do which will have the big influence in future. Never just care about the one can make influence for immediately.
