Hi, guys! I'm **Vincent**. 

This website is my personal English blog, which is used to record my life and flash ideas in English. It's my way to improve my english. So if you find some Enlgish errors or anything else about my blog, it will be very welcome to issue me in [my blog Github repository](https://github.com/luckti/luckti.github.io). issue.

Thanks to the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) team's great work, it's really an amazing tool to build website. And thank [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) for sharing the simple but beatiful theme.
